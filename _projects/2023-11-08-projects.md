Resilient and Scalable Pharmaceutical Supply Chains Design using Distributed Ledgers
======
This area will continue my current research, and I will keep on addressing the open challenges for creating a resilient Smart Healthcare applications especially counterfeit-free pharmaceutical supply chains

- Aim 1: Developing novel system architectures leveraging Distributed Ledger Technologies and Smart Contracts to create a transparent and secure Pharmaceutical Supply Chain, ensuring that pharmaceutical products can be accurately traced from production to consumption, thus reducing the risk of counterfeit drugs.
- Aim 2: Developing blockchain-based systems and smart contracts to streamline regulatory compliance and reporting processes for pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing regulatory oversight. 
- Aim 3: Utilize blockchain technology and IoT to enhance the efficiency of pharmaceutical supply chains by automatic processes, such as inventory management, tracking, and payment settlements, ultimately reducing delays and costs in the production and distribution of drugs.
