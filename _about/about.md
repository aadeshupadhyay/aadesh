<hr/>
I am a passionate and dedicated Ph.D. candidate in [Smart Electronic Systems Lab (SESL)](https://www.smohanty.org/SESL/index.html), Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of North Texas working under the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Saraju P Mohanty](https://www.smohanty.org/), specializing in cutting-edge technologies like <b>Distributed Ledger Systems, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Artificial Intelligence, and IoT systems especially applications in smart healthcare and smart agriculture.</b> <br>


My research revolves around solving multiple food and drug security issues. It leverages Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and Smart Contracts, with an emphasis on designing efficient and reliable Pharmaceutical Supply Chains to avoid counterfeit drug injection. Additionally, I work on multiple projects including <b>Blockchain-based Privacy Preserving Architectures for Prescription Management, Efficient Decision Support Tools for Smart Agriculture, and Energy Efficient and Scalable Blockchain Consensus Protocols for IoT Systems.</b> Motivation behind my research work is to develop solutions for safegaurding public health and well-being.
